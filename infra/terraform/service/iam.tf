# Task execution role: what the ECS agent needs to start the task (pull the

# AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy, maintained by AWS for exactly this role.
# The trust policy is scoped to this account's ECS tasks. There is no task
# role, because the app calls no AWS APIs; add one with its own policy when it
# does.
